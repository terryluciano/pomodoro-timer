# PomoTime
### A Simple Pomodoro Timer
I created this project to practice Vue.js and run the app locally on my network for convenient access from anywhere. I also used this opportunity to learn Docker, enabling me to deploy the app on a mini Intel NUC. At the time of publishing, I plan to add multiple apps to run on my Intel NUC.
